            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Have read that there were once a certain Sect of <hi>Athenians,</hi> or <hi>Peripateticks,</hi> who were of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that Man was made on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Honour, Pleasure and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: But if we consider what others since their time more seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous have written hereof, we shall finde their Opinion absurd and erroneous; Honour being as vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as a Princes eye: and there was never any pleasure in this world so durable, but that it was mixt with some pain, discontent or trouble: And as for Riches, no Philosopher ever yet, either Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent or Modern, could give a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient or satisfactory definition of it; there being no bounds to
<pb facs="tcp:55262:3"/> be set to a covetous mans desire: and therefore doubtless Man was made for some more notable end then these, if we consider his most wonderful frame; not only his external shape and comeliness of body, far surpassing all other living Creatures; but also by the inward gifts and endowments of his Minde, Nature having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on him a Sense far tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending the sense of other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; having endued him with Discourse, Reason and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to discern what, and what is not most proper for himself: although since our Fore father <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>'s time, by that great Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of his, he is always sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to errour: by which act, and the daily decay of Nature, we his Posterity are become much shorter-sighted then before that time we were; as is plainly manifest, if
<pb facs="tcp:55262:3"/> we do but consider that <hi>Adam,</hi> even at the first view, was able to give Names to all Creatures ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their kindes: and from thence we have great reason to think, that his Disobedience was the occasion of almost eclipsing our Ʋnderstanding. And as the Sun ever shineth, and seeth all things, unless its Beams be stopped by an interposition or opaque Body, as a Cloud, or some such thick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; even so the minde of man doubtless in its purity, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered alone by it self, did know all things: but now it b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing more intangled in the body, and darkned by its cloudiness and infirmities, can see nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leave and help of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. The minde then being thus intangled, must of necessity steer some other course, being she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not range abroad to see the shape
<pb facs="tcp:55262:4"/> of things as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but is forced to take the demonstration of them as she can receive them from the body, though poor and contemptible; and this cannot be done neither without imploying the <hi>Five Senses,</hi> which must operate too with their proper instruments in the same parts of the body, to bring in shapes or Idea's to the minde: and when all this is done, the minde yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands not, without an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter; the three inward Senses which lodge in the brain, the minde then laying all together, and comparing one with another, judges of them accordingly. Now if these Messengers of the Minde, or the places of the body where they lodge, be foul, gross, cloudy, thick, over-cold or hot, they give either a dull or false information to the Minde; so that man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:55262:4"/> do what he ought, nor possibly what he would, nor at all times what he should; neither that at one time which at another time he is able to do. Yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, he is doubtless at all times, and in all places, chiefly to contemplate his Maker, and that Oeconomy he hath placed in the larger Ʋniverse: In all which, we finde not the least grass but hath something of his Power stamped thereon: a true defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which we cannot now at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto; guess we may (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though but darkly) at the life and death of a Vegetable, and how it may come to continue the same Individuation, and be again the same Identical Body, after so many strange changes, and after so many different shapes as may be seen in the course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55262:5"/>
            <p>Seeing the Minde then is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled, it will not be amiss to proportion the end we propose to our selves in any thing to be within our power or short sight; for if otherwise it be impossible to obtain our desires, it may instead of affording us content and good, become our affliction and ruine. And seeing that all things in the world tend to some end, even things insensible seem to advance to some proper use, as if they did apprehend a perfection of their being; I say, much more requisite and necessary is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Man, whose minde and thoughts are continually acting▪ should always be honestly imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it being the ready High-wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> happiness which all Pious Soul hope for. Let us press on there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:55262:5"/> whilst we are here, and be no more idle: for a standing Puddle is more subject to corruption, then the running Stream: Steel, the less used, is the sooner eaten with Rust: the Atoms, in infectious times, by little and little, work on hot and moist bodies, most subject to putrefaction, until they have corrupted the whole mass. Even so Man, letting the Reins of his Will run at random, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying his time in some honest Exercise, by the allurements of the world, having much converse therein, is in great danger, by little and little, of being wholly corrupted, daily walking amongst our Enemies who seek to dev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ur us; and being once taken and intangled in their Net, it will be hard for us to get free from it again, until we sink down, and are drowned.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55262:6"/>
            <p>I remember that in a place call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Camanas,</hi> which lyeth to the Lew-ward of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> the <hi>Sea-Tortoise</hi> (of which there are five sorts) or <hi>Turtles,</hi> as some call them, those triple-hearted Amphibious Creatures (for they have each of them three distinct Hearts) being intangled in a Sain or Net which was usually set for the taking of them, or else being turned on their backs on Land (for then they cannot turn themselves on their feet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain) did always sigh, sob, shed tears, and mightily seem to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as being most sensible of their destruction, and that they were in their Enemies hands. So should all good Christians do that are taken in the Evil Net of the Sensualities of this World, until they get out, lest they perish ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:55262:6"/>
            <p>But we have already exceeded the bounds of an Epistle; and therefore will conclude with speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing something of that followeth in the ensuing Treatise.</p>
            <p>Which Discourse, if you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to finde deckt up with fine Metaphysical Notions and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, or stuft with hard or strange words (with which the <hi>Indies</hi> do abound) or if you think to finde it in a Court-like stile, or adorned with Poetical Fancies; you are likely to be mistaken, and quite beside the Cushion, for you will finde it only in plain and easie Terms, such as I my self best understand: Nor was this written in a Closet or Study, in the corner of a house, amongst many Books; but the most of it, some time since, was taken, with many other Observations, rather in travelling the Woods, and
<pb facs="tcp:55262:7"/> other parts, (when I had leisure at odd times to go on shore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then belonging to one of his Majesties Ships of War) espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in that praise worthy Island of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> which lieth between the Tropicks within the limits of the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> in seventeen and eighteen degrees of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Latitude; the place, as well as the very name, being to our Ancestors so terrible and frightful, that they concluded it (as well as the <hi>Frigid Zone)</hi> not to be inhabited: but they were guided only by the Dictates of their own Reason▪ which Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath since sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, and doth now proclaim it to be as temperate, healthful and beneficial, as most places are in the <hi>Temperate Zone,</hi> as well for us English men, as others, by reason of the breezes or gales of
<pb facs="tcp:55262:7"/> Winde that do there continually blow and qualifie the sulphurous Air. Neither is it the near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Sun that is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the cause of heat, or its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of cold; but we may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute much to the Conjunction of the Sun with other luminous Bodies, the Aspects with other Planets, their Configurations with other Stars: as we see in the Dog-daies, that it is often much hotter then before, although at that time the daies are much short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the Sun at a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from us. But of this else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
            <p>'Tis likely some may say, What need we trouble our selves with those things we cannot reach? To such I answer, That the most part of them here mentioned which grow not in <hi>England</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, are brought over daily and
<pb facs="tcp:55262:8"/> made use of, either for Meat, Medicine, or imployed in several sorts of Trades, and the like: Besides, this may be necessary to all which first travel to those parts; for I have wanted such Directions, and so I doubt not but some others do: However, I suppose there are few but would gladly know, that there are such things in the world, although scarcely any which care or desire to go to see them; and large Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes have been written of bare report only, of Countries, Places, and their Productions; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hope this Description (which is as nigh to truth as I could possibly draw it, if my eye-sight failed me not) may be acceptable, although it be far short of what I intended; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my desire to have made it more compleat by one more Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb facs="tcp:55262:8"/> into those parts of the World, in which my endeavours should not have been wanting for the bringing and fitting of Roots, Seeds, and other Vegetables, to our Climate, for to increase the number of Rarities which we have here in our Gardens alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; in the which I perceive much may be done, if further industry were used: but I have yet met with no opportunity to accomplish the same; and therefore hope that some others who have convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy will do something herein, for the promotion of further know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in these and many other excellent things which those parts afford, and we are yet unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with. And whosoever is offended at this that I have here written, may let it alone; it forceth none to meddle with it: I know the best things dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
<pb facs="tcp:55262:9"/> some; neither was there ever any man yet that could please all people: but in hurting none, possi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THough my designe in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Treatise, is chiefly to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of certain Trees, Fruits, Herbs, Roots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made use of, either for Meat or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, whilst I abode in the <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:55262:13"/> yet shall I offer to the perusal of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two or three remarkable things which were exposed to my considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on when I first visited the shore; which indeed, although they grow, yet cannot properly be called Herbs, Roots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The first of which to be described is,</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>White Coral.</head>
               <p>OF White Coral Rocks there are great abundance in <hi>America,</hi> and also up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Coast of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> especially in the Shallows and Harbours: It groweth and brancheth up in the Sea, from the main bulk, into round pieces of different proportions, some bigger, and some less then a mans finger; one joyned to the other with curious branches, being all over rough, and beset with small bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, after so delicate a fashion, as will undoubtedly raise admiring thoughts in the serious beholder of so wonderful a Rarity. These Rocks are exceedingly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, not only to great Ships, but also to lesser Vessels, as Boats, whose lightness might seem to exempt them from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, which have been often hazarded by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55262:13"/> their approaching too near them. Not long after, we came to an Anchor in that stately Harbour at Point <hi>Cagaway</hi> in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica:</hi> Some of our Ships Company be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sent forth in a new Shallop, with an intent to make a Voyage to the <hi>Camanas</hi> for <hi>Tortoise</hi> (or <hi>Turtles,</hi> as they call them there) and being not well fitted (as it fell out) to stay, ran the Vessel with such violence upon one of these Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral-Rocks, that it sunk her down so deep, that the men stood in the water, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with fears, lest the merciless Waves should wash them away, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some leagues distant from any Land or shore: But keeping their Powder, and some Guns above water, and with great frequency firing them, the Winde being favourable, the report was carried to shore; which causing there in the hearers a suspition of some extraordinary disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, (such Signals being the usual Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishers of more then a common calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) they thereupon, with all possible speed, putting off some Boats to Sea to discover the real cause, in ten or twelve hours space afforded them a seasonable relief, and preserved the men from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55262:14"/> an almost remediless destruction.</p>
               <p>Another time we were crossing the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned Harbour from <hi>Liganee</hi> to the Point, (the principal Sea-port so called in <hi>Jamaica</hi>) and espying a <hi>Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dile</hi> (or <hi>Allegator,</hi> as they there name them) we then dispatcht it with our Oars: But first, in the pursuit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, we ran our Long-Boat on a Coral-Rock, whence with much danger and difficulty we got her off. And seeing I have mentioned a <hi>Crocodile,</hi> give me leave to add something, as it were, in a Parenthesis, concerning that kinde of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal: They are at first but little, being inclosed in an Egg-shell, out of which I have taken them my self: the old one, at the accustomed season of the year, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a hole in the Sand, lays her Eggs th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>re; and covering or concealing them, leaves them to the influence of the Sun for their more effectual production; where, by the continuance of a moderate heat, they are in a short time quickned, and gain such strength, as to make a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>each in the shell; and thence they are no sooner freed, but they betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>These Coppers are set all one by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther athwart the end of the Sugar-house, or Curing-house (as they term it) so that the upper edges of each Copper do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most touch each other, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In <hi>Jamaica</hi> they have a very pretty and easie way for the producing of good Salt, thus: near the Sea-side they dig a low place, as it were a Laugh or Pond, and pave it very even, and with a Sluce let in some of the Sea-water, an inch, two inches, or three inches deep, or more; and there let it remain, and the Sun in a short time turneth it into Salt: and if they have occasion to use it quickly, they

But this only by digression: I think it needless here to say any thing more of the Vertues of Sugar, it being so fully done by others already.</p>

I have been told by the <hi>Negroes,</hi> that in <hi>Guinee</hi> they take the outer rinde of these Nuts (they being of a fibrous substance) and tease it, and card it out into a kinde of <hi>Okam;</hi> and then make Ropes and Cordage thereof, and also Sails for their Boats, and such other uses: but in <hi>Jamaica</hi> they esteem it not, being better furnished with other mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials for that purpose.

This is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently used in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and is nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and corroborating; by which the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Proverb is made good, that this Nut affordeth both meat, drink and cloth.</p>

                  <p>Of these Trees, there are several sorts which grow to a reasonable height: the bodies of the largest do usually arrive in bulk (although not in talness) to the largeness of our English Plum-Trees: they are in every part smoothe; and the boughs and branches thereof extend themselves on every side, to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a well-spread Tree, much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling our Heart-Cherry-Tree (so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated from the similitude the fruit hath with a Heart) but at its full growth 'tis dilated to a greater breadth in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, and is something loftier: There's little difference in the leaves, these being pointed, but smoother on the edges, and in colour of a darker green, more like the leaves of an Orange-Tree; the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers thereof are almost of a Saffron-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour: Immediately after the appearance of these, the fruit proceeds from the boughs and branches, not admitting of any intermedium, or stem, as Apples do. These Trees commonly bear fruit within seven years space, or less, after their first Plantation; though in the interim they are sometimes twice or thrice removed,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:55262:66"/> and great care taken to secure them with shades of <hi>Plantane</hi> and <hi>Bonana</hi>-Trees, that they may not be injured by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-powerful heat of the scorching Sun, of which they are not in danger, when they once become great, being then ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to shelter and defend each other.</p>

But in this I conceive there is a great mistake; for it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to those Regions (by reason of heat) for all women (how ruddy soever they are when they first come there) to alter their complexions, and in short time become pale or yellowish: and doubtless women in <hi>England</hi> might eat a long time of these <hi>Cacao's,</hi> before they would finde any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration or change thereby in themselves: And I have my self eaten in <hi>Jamaica,</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:55262:69"/> and at Sea, great quantities of them; neither did I finde any sensible difference at all thereby: Indeed, there is great care to be taken in the choice of them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of such as are brought into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that you chuse them that are well cured, well tasted, not musty, mouldy, or much venny within when they are broken; and such as seem fat and oyly are best: Also pick forth all those which are corrupt, before you make use of the rest. The truth is, how well soever they may seem to be cured when they are in the place where they grow, and how carefully soever stowed in the Ship; yet by transportation, the Air of different places hath such an operation upon them, that many are corrupted and spoiled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they arrive here; and so they are often, by reason of moisture, soon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, if they are not carefully look'd unto, dryed, and used in time. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this, the <hi>Cacao's,</hi> how well soever cured at first, have yet remaining in them a certain oyliness, or thin moisture, which is apt to tend to corruption, in all the chinks and little crevices all over them, which seem whitish when broken; and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55262:69"/> therefore must the use of them, in that respect only, be somewhat different from what they are in their Native Climate, fresh and new; and the more decayed they are, the greater the difference is: So that I am perswaded there is no better Chocolate to be had in <hi>England,</hi> then that which Mariners and Sea-men bring; which is made up in the Country where the <hi>Cacao's</hi> naturally grow.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Jamaica</hi> there is a sort of Choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late made up of only the Paste of the <hi>Cacao</hi> it self, in rowls or lumps of a pound or two, or three pound together, the better for keeping good; which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple there account most ordinary, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son they bestow not so much pains as to grinde it into the smallest particles; and being but grosly made up, they grate it very fine, immediately before they use it for drinks: And this is one of the best masses of Chocolate-Paste that is; and it may be had often here in <hi>England,</hi> neat and good, of Merchants and Sea-men that travel to those parts, and bring it over: nor is it at all material or conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that it be always beaten into such ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry small parts, the different Airs it will
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55262:70"/> meet with before it come here, being thereby the more apt to work upon it: Besides, it doth dissipate the spirits, which are naturally volatile, and soon vanish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, leaving the rest much more insipid; and therefore an indifferent respect must be used in the beating or grinding of it.</p>

                  <p>These Trees grow in <hi>America</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers places, especially in the Spanish Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; as in <hi>Nicaragua, New Spain, Mexico, Cuba, Hispaniola, &amp;c.</hi> and in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica</hi> they grow plentifully at a place called by the name of Colonel <hi>Barring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Quarters or Plantations▪ (so called, by reason he had the first possession and command of them after the English came thither:) and in the <hi>Long-Walk</hi> there grow very many; as also in divers other places of that Island, in less numbers.</p>
                  <p>They prosper best in low ground, and in fat and rank earth, which must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, before they are planted, be laid in good order, and cleared from all kinde of rubbish and incumbrances; and then they are planted, it may be many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds together, sufficiently furnishing ten or twelve Acres of ground, or more or
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55262:70"/> less, according as the Planters interest extends, or as the place happeneth to lye convenient for that purpose.</p>
                  <p>These Trees are for the most part squarely and orderly set, about six, seven or eight foot distance from each other, as the Cherry-Trees in <hi>Kent</hi> or <hi>Worcester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> are planted; all the insterstices or spaces between them being kept clean from long grass, and all other such of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiveness as might be any way likely to hinder the force of the ground, or them from their increase in growth.</p>
                  <p>And under these Trees (especially those which are nigh their houses) they keep the grass between the rows evenly cut, and the ground rowled, so that the Greens are pleasant to walk in at any time of the day, the Trees covering and shading all the ground.</p>
                  <p>These Trees were long since planted in <hi>Jamaica</hi> by the Spaniards, and were of great esteem and much benefit; and so they are now with the English Planters; and with great reason indeed, for they deserve no less, if we seriously consider the benefit they afford to all, as well Strangers as Natives, or those that are Naturaliz'd.</p>

               <head>Of the making of <hi>Chocolate</hi> into Drink.</head>
               <p>IN the making of that so-much-fam'd or Renowned Drink, (which may be called the <hi>American Nectar</hi>) at this day well known in most parts of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by the name of <hi>Chocolate,</hi> there are many and various ways used, as well in <hi>India</hi> as <hi>Europe:</hi> The later of which I shall speak nothing at all to; but to the former, I will relate what I have acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally seen and made use of in those parts; as also what some have written of it long since, who approved and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the same to others.</p>
               <p>This Drink is often made several ways; some using one way, and some another, as seemeth best and most familiar to them: and therefore we will begin with that which is most generally known, and that which all common people, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants also, before they go forth to work in the Plantations in a morning, take a draught or two of, for the better support of Nature in their hard labour.</p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:55262:78"/>
               <p>For this, they take of the Balls or Lumps made up only of the <hi>Cacao,</hi> when they are thorough dry and hard (for they ought to be at least nine daies or a fort-night old fermenting, before they be made use of) and grate it very small on a Tin-Grater, such as Cooks use to grate their bread on, or the like; but it ought to be finer, I mean, the holes thereof made smaller, holding the piece of <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colate</hi> lightly on it, that it may be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted very fine into some dish, or the like convenient thing, as may be fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</p>
               <p>The quantity to be grated is as much as shall be thought fit for present use at that time, more or less, according to the number of the company to drink thereof, according to the greater or smaller proportion as every ones appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite requires; or as is desired to be made thicker or thinner, and the like; order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things for the making thereof with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exact limitation. Then they take as much fair water out of the Spring or Jar (for some have Jars for the keeping fresh water cool) as they think will be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently answerable to their ingredients;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55262:78"/> and in that water, they put about as much, or else somewhat less <hi>Casava</hi>-bread, as the quantity of the grated <hi>Chocolate.</hi> This bread being a while in the cold water, although it be not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but only broken into bits or small pieces, and put therein, will dissolve in a little time; which in hot water it is not so apt to do: (yet it may be grated and put in with the <hi>Chocolate.</hi>) When it is dissolved, they set that water on the fire in the <hi>Chocolate</hi>-Pot, Kettle, or what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vessel they see good; and when it boils, they put in the grated <hi>Chocolate,</hi> and make it boil again a quarter of an hour, or less, stirring it a little in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim: and then taking it off the fire, they pour it out of the Pot, or what else it was boiled in, into some handsome large Dish or Bason: and after they have sweetned it a little with Sugar, being all together, and sitting down round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it like good Fellows, every one dips in his <hi>Calabash,</hi> or some other Dish, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it off very hot.</p>
               <p>And this is their usual Breakfast; without which, servants or others are not well able to perform their most la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious

               <p>There is yet another way, and that is especially used by <hi>Maroonoes, Hunters,</hi> and such as have occasion to travel the Country, to be ready at all times, which is Balls or Lozanges finely made up with <hi>Cacao,</hi> and some of the fore-mentioned ingredients besides, and as much Sugar as will sufficiently sweeten it: and when they have an inclination to make use of those Tablets or Lozanges, they only dissolve them in water, froth it, or stir it well, and so drink it off: And this exceeds a Scotch-mans provision of Oat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal and Water, as much (in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) as the best Ox-Beef for strong sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks exceeds the meanest food.</p>

               <p>The Spanish Physitians have nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:55262:81"/> and appointed many Ingredients or Simples to make this Drink a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, but very insignificantly, and to little or no purpose, it being much wholesomer of it self. And truly, what we now use in <hi>England,</hi> is but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of Spices, Milk, Eggs, Sugar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and perhaps there is in it a fourth or sixth part of the chiefest ingredient, the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cao;</hi> whereby the intention of what it should be, and the property thereof from what it naturally is in it self, is quite changed.</p>
               <p>So that it is no wonder if this Drink be not found of that vertue and efficacy as hath been noised abroad, or as many expect: But doubtless if Physitians did but narrowly pry into the secrets of the nature of it, they would quickly finde (the right use thereof being made) that it can scarcely be too much commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>It is the adulteration of this Nectar which undeservedly makes it ill thought of, and causlesly that which hath been (and deserves now to be) most famous, to become in the esteem of some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous, by the mixing of things impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55262:81"/> therewith; endeavouring in sicknes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to order this as fitting Physick for all kinde of distempers, let the constitution be what it will; and to administer it in any Climate or Air, is the common pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of many at this day, whereby the excellency thereof is abated; neither ought it to be taken any otherwise then (as indeed it is in it self) a most proper Aliment.</p>
               <p>And therefore let all such who desire to drink it for their health, see the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it themselves, I mean, as well the Lump as the Drink, unless they can have such from <hi>Jamaica,</hi> or any other place, as is good and simply made up, as I have before-mentioned.</p>
               <p>That which I shall further mention of this Drink before I conclude, will be most of it concerning what others have long since written of it.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Chocolate</hi> (say they) is made into drink several ways; sometimes dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving what quantity is thought fitting in hot water, sometimes in cold; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times making an addition of other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, and sometimes not. When it is put into hot water and boiled, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55262:82"/> well stirred, they do afterwards drink it as hot as it can well be endured; not using any exercise for half an hour, or an hour after: half an hour in a morning before work, is enough; but if it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at noon for dinner, to rest an hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is but sufficient, not only for this, but for any other nourishment in so hot a Climate as the <hi>Indies</hi> (especially within the <hi>Torrid Zone</hi>) before much exercise is used: and it is the custom among most of the Planters, to leave work at eleven of the Clock, eating their dinner by twelve at the farthest, and so rest themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til one, before they go to work again.</p>
               <p>This Drink ought to be prepared only for present use, which is sometimes done by making the water boil, or ready to boil; and then put forth some of that water, and put therein the <hi>Chocolate;</hi> and when it is dissolved, mill it well, and add thereto as much water more as will make it hot; and so drink it presently after milling the second time.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s Drink is very easily made at any time, having always by you the Rowls or Cakes ready made up; and it is best being made indifferently thick, although some make
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55262:82"/> it so thin, that the <hi>Chocolate</hi> can scarcely be seen in it; which is not so good.</p>
               <p>I remember at <hi>Mevis</hi> I drank of a mess of <hi>Chocolate</hi> made by a Planter, after this manner.</p>
               <p>First, He took some water and made it ready to boil; and in the interim, he grated as much <hi>Chocolate</hi> as he thought fit, according to the company, to drink thereof at that time. Also he beat three Eggs very well; then he put in the <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colate,</hi> and a little <hi>Casava</hi> beaten small, and some <hi>Maiz</hi>-Flour: All which made it indifferently thick; and when it was just boiled up, he put in the Eggs, and sweetned it a little with Sugar; and when it had boiled less then a quarter of an hour after, he frothed it, and poured it forth into a Dish. This seemed very handsom to the eye, and I am sure it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted much better, being drunk not only very hot, but also very merrily.</p>
               <p>And this way of making it is almost the same, as not long afterwards I eat of some which was made at a place call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Liganee</hi> in <hi>Jamaica;</hi> and truly I think this to be none of the worst way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it; for I observed, that it had very
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55262:83"/> much of the Oyl or Vegetative fat swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on the top of it.</p>
               <p>There is yet another sort of this Drink often made use of, especially by Hunters, Travellers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who have seldom any Vessels or conveniency of boiling it; and therefore to supply the want of all such, it may easily be made ready upon any present occasion; as thus: They have <hi>Chocolate</hi> which is very finely beaten, and made up into little Cakes, with a sufficient quantity of Sugar to sweeten them: Of these Cakes, those that tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel always carry with them; and also a <hi>Calabash,</hi> or some other small Vessel; and when they meet with good water, (of which there is great store) they take thereof, and put into it some of their <hi>Chocolate,</hi> and (if they have it) <hi>Casava</hi>-bread, as much as will make it indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently thick: and when it is almost dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, they stir it together, or else mill it, and so drink it cold; or else some put in a spoonful or two of <hi>Rum</hi> or <hi>Brandy</hi> into every dish, if they have it: and this kinde of food agreeth very well with them that are accustomed to it, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth the want of all other Aliment.</p>

               <p>THis most Excellent Nectar hath been for a long time, and also is now a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry familiar Drink; and in most places that are considerable, throughout the greatest part of <hi>America,</hi> they make thereof; and all of them unanimously, of what rank or quality soever, take a mornings drink of it; yea, even the meanest servants, before they go forth to work, do take a draught thereof, or else they are hardly able to hold out and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their tasks until eleven a Clock, their usual time of going to dinner; not so much by reason of any extraordinary heat that would offend them more there then in many places of <hi>Europe,</hi> were it not for the multitude of wood (for want of Inhabitants) which is not yet cut down and destroyed, which very much hinders the free passage of the Air; as by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence we finde in <hi>England,</hi> the heat in the midst of Summer much greater in Woods and Lanes, then in the more open Fields,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55262:84"/> where the Air hath more free motion and passage: And this is the greatest reason why it is thought to be hotter at <hi>Jamai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> that lieth in seventeen degrees, then at <hi>Barbados</hi> in thirteen; because the Wood is, for the most part, destroyed in <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos;</hi> but in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> as yet, but little of it is cut down or rooted up, although no doubt, in short time, it will be otherwise, more people coming daily thither; and then certainly it will be as temperate a Climate as can be desired, because there always blows a strong Sea-breeze (as they call it) or gale of winde from the Sea all day, that doth much fan and cool the Air until night; the Sun drawing on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Point, it then doth blow more gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Land, returning again to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea in the morning. And thus varying once in twelve hours, doth for the most part keep its course, both to the great benefit of the Inhabitants, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who travel thither.</p>
               <p>Those Woods are the Harbour and Nurseries of a small and very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some Fly, called a <hi>Musqueto;</hi> and another like unto that Fly we call a <hi>Gnat</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> which they call <hi>Merry-wings,</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:55262:84"/> because they hum and make a noyse: These are both venomous, and so great a torment (to strangers especially) as they can hardly sleep, unless they are provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Gloves and Leather-Stockings to keep them from stinging; for Worsted or Linnen Stockings will not defend them: but near unto the Sea-side, where the winde hath more freedom, they scarce trouble or molest at all: however, amongst many conveniencies, we may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low some inconveniencies; for the worst wood there is as useful for the making of Sugar, as any here is for the making of Iron, the best not at all inferiour to any wood in the world. But to break off from this digression which fell in by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, let us speak what we intended of the vertues of this Nectar, <hi>Chocolate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not convenient, as experience hath sufficiently taught us, to eat or drink any thing else quickly after the drinking of it; or presently to use any immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate exercise; but rather to rest a while, whether it be taken hot or cold: b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And certainly all kinde of Drinks, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther naturally hot, or artificially made so, especially in hot Countries, are most wholesome; and therefore doubtless <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colate</hi> is most properly drunk here in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: And I think all rational persons, who have ever been in the <hi>Indies,</hi> will conceive it so to be, by the frequent drinking of <hi>Rum, Brandy,</hi> and other strong and hot Spirits; which doth suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently prove, that if such strong liquors are good at any time, (as doubtless they are) they are best in Summer, when the weather is most hot: for should we here drink much of it in Winter, it must of necessity be our ruine; because, by so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we put flame to fire our natural parts, being more hot to withstand the coldness of the Climate, the pores less, and the skin more compact; and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the external circumambient Air, a greater fixation of Spirits is ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sed thereby, then in those hotter Regions, as may be apparently perceived in Summer; out of which more open pores, the blood and radical moisture doth by exhalation more freely transpire; and therefore of necessity Nature doth require a better sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55262:85"/> to maintain the internal heat. And it is well observed by some, that most of those who travel from the more Norther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly parts of the world into the <hi>Indies,</hi> before they are Naturalized there, do, as it were, Serpent or Adder-like, change their skin; that is, the external thin skin, or scarf-skin, called the <hi>Cuticula,</hi> doth peel off, there coming in the place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of another, yet more thin and lank then that was: And such persons as lose not their skin after this manner, do for the most part become desperately ill, and perhaps not escape death, because the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liginous vapours want a more free tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piration; to procure which, <hi>Chocolate</hi> is most excellent, it nourishing and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving health entire, purging by Expecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and especially by the sweat-vents of the body, preventing unnatural fumes ascending to the head, yet causing a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and natural sle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55262:86"/> eaten twice a day, a man may very well subsist therewith, not taking any thing else at all; and if need so require, many daies together.</p>
               <p>The hardy Sea-men having been long kept from fresh diet, do often, when they come on shore amongst the Rarities of those Countries, too freely eat of them, more then Nature is able to turn into act, or dispence with, by which means many vicious humours are ingendred; or else (by reason of them which were before lodged in the body) it so falleth out, that many of them are quickly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their arrival there much troubled with Pustules, Tumours or Swellings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which <hi>Chocolate</hi> supped scalding hot, (for so it is usually drunk) is excellent to drive forth such offensive humours, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the pores, and causing moderate sweats, and may be taken without ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving an exact quantity; only all ought to consider their own strength; and that one that is very aged, or a Childe, cannot (neither ought they if they could) take so great a quantity at a time, as those in full strength; but every one may take it according to his appetite and digestive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty;
